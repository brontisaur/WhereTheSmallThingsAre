# Where the Small Things are

## Synopsis

Adrienne is a singular personality. That is at least what they tell themselves to deal with the apparent rejection they deal with daily. It is, unfortunately, not the best way to cope with academic struggle in the very subject they live for. Getting absorbed into DragonRPG rulesets and DIY miniatures are likewise not effective coping strategies.

But now they are literally absorbed into DragonRPG. Like: literally, literally. One moment, they were spiraling about an exam at 3:00 am, and the next they are chugging some unidentified potion whilst fleeing a giant. Being saved by Sir Mouse, a knight flying an armoured sparrow, yields more questions than answers. 

As Adrienne comes to terms with their singular new existence in this singularly confusing world, it becomes quickly apparent that none of their current coping mechanisms are helpful to Sir Mouse and his miniature friends in this world's unfolding peril. With nothing familiar and yet everything strange now precious, Adrienne has to put aside their navel-gazing and step up. 

Will they be able to save the place where the small things are?

Adrienne is a heavily autistic-coded character.

## Main Plot Thread

The main plot thread is a parallel story. Adrienne's main plot thread directly informs the Small Things' plot and vice versa. Technically, most of Adrienne's plot takes place _within_ the small things plot, but because of story reasons the reader (or, well, Adrienne) does not have access to out-of-small-things dependencies explicitly. For this reason, it is useful to outline these parallel plots separately.

NOTE: Adrienne's plot in itself is very spoilery. These elements are referenced in the Small Things' plot, but are only truly revealed/unveiled at the end of the book, and even then the reader is left to guess.

### Adrienne's Plot
Adrienne is struggling deeply with their identity, social life, and a deep existential depression. They fall deeper and deeper into their DragonRPG obsession to deal with their academic failures when that part of their identity fails to mask their existential terminality. They garner lots of interest in a new campaign, but players struggle to join the campaigns very consistently for long. 

By the start of the story, they are in a very bad and isolated mental place. They perceive rejection everywhere they go, even if it is not real, and their biggest rejection looms in their mind before them. They are writing a definitive exam the next morning. They have catastrophically set ultimatums in their mind about what failing this exam will mean. Their executive function has pinned them before their desk: not studying, but obsessively plotting out a homebrew DragonRPG campaign with custom rules from three different ruleset versions while a mousefolk paladin miniature stares down at them disapprovingly. 

Adrienne gets a meltdown, and very violently begins self-harming and throwing items around. They throw the mouse mini against the wall. [this is where the reader's perspective switches to the Small Thing's plot. Adrienne's memory grows incredibly fuzzy at this point.]
